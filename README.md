Ocean Simulation exercise.

The oceaan is a 2-D array populated by an assortment of beings:
- empty space.
- rock - doesn't move and blocks any creature from moving into the space.
- plankton - grows and reproduces at regular intervals.
- fish - grows, reproduces and eats plankton and smaller fish.  Will die if too long without eating.
- shark - same as fish, but will always take the opportunity to eat fish and smaller sharks.  Will attack a larger shark if hungry enough.
